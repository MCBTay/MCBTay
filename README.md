### :octocat: Oh, hello 👋

:tiger2: Clemson University graduate and fan :tiger2:

I'm a developer working in Atlanta, Georgia.

At a previous job, I was working with C#, .NET Framework/.NET 5, WPF, and GraphQL using several open source and known libraries such as, but not limited to:
- 🌶️ 🍫 [Hot Chocolate, Strawberry Shake, and Banana Cake Pop](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate)
- [Material Design in XAML](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit)
- [XUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit), [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture), and [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) for testing
- [EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) for database interaction
- [Mapster](https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster)

In my current role, we're building .NET APIs with an Angular front end.

🛹 I've written a few mods for a skateboarding game, SkaterXL, utilizing C# and Unity in my free time.
- Heavily utilizing [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to extend/replace base game functionality.
