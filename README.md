### :octocat: Oh, hello 👋

:tiger2: Clemson University graduate and fan :tiger2:

I'm a full stack .NET developer working in Atlanta, Georgia.

At a previous job, I was working with C#, .NET Framework/.NET 5, WPF, and GraphQL using several open source and known libraries such as, but not limited to:
- 🌶️ 🍫 [Hot Chocolate, Strawberry Shake, and Banana Cake Pop](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate)
- [Material Design in XAML](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit)
- [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions)
- [XUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit)
- [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture)
- [EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore)
- [Mapster](https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster)

🛠️ I'm starting to tinker with and learn more JavaScript and web based frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, and Blazor.

🛹 I've written a few mods for a skateboarding game, SkaterXL, utilizing C# and Unity in my free time.
