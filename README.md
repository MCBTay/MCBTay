### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack .NET developer working in Atlanta, Georgia.

At my previous job, I was working with C#, .NET Framework/.NET 5, WPF, and GraphQL daily utilizing [Hot Chocolate, Strawberry Shake, and Banana Cake Pop](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate).

I'm starting to tinker with and learn more JavaScript and web based frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, and Blazor.

I've written a few mods for a skateboarding game, SkaterXL, utilizing C# and Unity in my free time.
